Good Evening Gousib. 



This is to share with you that today is my last working day for PGS as I communicated suddenly with a call from my company as per the feedback received from PGS Management and Technical team.



I may not be technically matching skills like Prakhyat all together in scripting and automation but I'm a certified AWS Associate professional and good in Cloud operations, Patching exercises, communication and daily ticketing tasks needed. I should must given a chance and intimation at least to take this decision.



So.. Sadly... May be I may not available from tomorrow.. I was working and learning well with you and Team. This was really a health session of working in last 30 days.
