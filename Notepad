Good Evening Gousib,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my time here at PGS as my last working day has suddenly arrived, thanks to a call from the company in response to feedback received from the PGS Management and Technical team.

While I may not possess the exact technical skills as Prakhyat does in scripting and automation, I take pride in being a certified AWS Associate professional with a strong background in Cloud operations, Patching exercises, effective communication, and daily ticketing tasks. Given the opportunity and proper notice, I believe I could have demonstrated my value further.

Unfortunately, it appears that I may not be available starting tomorrow. Working alongside you and the entire team has been a valuable experience for me, and I have truly appreciated the chance to learn and grow during my time here. The past 30 days have been a significant chapter in my career, and I will always look back on this period with fond memories.

Thank you for your support and guidance during my tenure at PGS. I hope our paths cross again in the future, and I wish the team continued success in all their endeavors.
