CloudFormation template for creating an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with CloudWatch alarms and access logs:

Metadata and Parameter Groups:

The template includes metadata and parameter groups to organize and label the parameters in the AWS CloudFormation Designer. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each parameter.
Parameters:

The template defines several parameters that allow you to customize the ALB configuration:
AutomationAssumeRoleARN: The ARN of an existing IAM role that allows AssumeRole to be performed on your behalf.
SecurityGroupId: The ID of an existing security group (SG) that you want to associate with the ALB.
PublicSubnetId1 and PublicSubnetId2: The IDs of two existing public subnets where the ALB should be deployed.
VpcId: The ID of the existing VPC in which the ALB will be created.
AWSALBAccountId: The AWS account ID that will have access to put logs in the designated S3 bucket for ALB access logs.
Resources:

AutomationAssumeRole: This resource defines an IAM Role that grants the Elastic Load Balancing service the permission to assume this role. It uses the AutomationAssumeRoleARN parameter to specify the role's ARN.
AccessLogBucket: An S3 bucket resource that stores the ALB access logs. It has a lifecycle configuration to expire logs after 365 days and public access block settings for security.
ALBLoggingBucketPolicy: An S3 bucket policy that allows the specified AWS account (defined by AWSALBAccountId parameter) to put objects (logs) into the access log bucket. It ensures that the bucket owner has full control over the logs.
LoadBalancer: The Application Load Balancer resource that is created using the provided parameters for name, scheme, type, and subnet IDs. It also specifies the associated security group and the S3 bucket for access logs.
TargetGroup: The Target Group resource that defines the health check settings for the ALB targets, such as the protocol, port, and health check path.
Listener: The ALB Listener resource that listens on port 80 and forwards incoming requests to the target group.
CloudWatchAlarm: An Amazon CloudWatch Alarm resource that monitors the ALB's request count metric. It triggers an alarm if the request count exceeds the specified threshold (1000 requests per minute).
Outputs:

ALBEndpoint: An output that provides the DNS name of the created ALB. You can use this value to access your application through the load balancer.
Overall, this template allows you to create an Application Load Balancer, configure access logging to an S3 bucket, and set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the request count on the ALB. It also provides parameterization to customize the ALB configuration based on your requirements.
